Version 1.3, 10 april :
	* TO DO :	Need to Test values of new angles constante duty for Servo
	* TO DO :	Need to Test values of new delay for rotate 90 and 180
	* Stop program with Ctr+C (Program wait a SignINT to Stop Motor, replace servo and finsiih program proprely)
	* Changed Behavior of Roaming Algorithm
	* Added Angle of Scanning (22.5, 45, and 67.5 degre for the both side)
	* Added Lib Detect ( Not Yet Used)
	* Added In Lib Algo Test Function
	* Added more time for the Rotate 90 Delay


Version 1.2, 09 april :
	* Add Lib Algo, Add Roaming Function
	* Scanning area to Three place (Lft, Center and Right)
	* Tick each Second
	* Need to change Timming delay for a good 90 and 180 Rotation
	* Need to change the behavior for scanning, Detectin too late
		

Version 1.1, 09 april  :
	* Standard libraries Working ( Lib motor, Lib Servo, Lib Sonar)
	* Things to do : * Add Lib Detect
